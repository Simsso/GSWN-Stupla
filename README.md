# GSWN-Stupla
A simple app showing the time table of the Gewerbliche Schule Waiblingen

Google PlayStore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.timodenk.gswnstupla

Usually you had to visit the website of the Gewerbliche Schule (www.gswn.de) and select your class every time. The app stores the chosen class and shows your time table directly after starting the application.

For fetching the classes and other information from the gswn.de-server there is a PHP-webserver online which responds with JSON objects to the app's requests (GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Simsso/GSWN-Stupla-Server).
